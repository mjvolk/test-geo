<b>Using Data in Spreadsheets</b><br/><br/>

Microsoft Excel has known limitations when working with TSV and CSV files that have character encodings like UTF8 (the character encoding of the AidData CSV Data).To avoid potential problems with character encodings, please use the “From Text”command on the Data menu when opening the CSV files. Double-clicking on the files to open in Excel, and/or saving them as CSV from Excel may result in character encoding problems.

Additionally, AidData provides all final tabular data as TAB separated files. If asked by your software which delimiter to use, you should select TAB. <b> PLEASE BE CAREFUL TO ONLY USE ONE DELIMITER (not for example, comma and TAB)</b>
